## Type of change

- [ ] Bug fix in an existing tool

- [ ] Tool-surface change (rename/remove a tool, change a confirm gate or annotation) — opened an issue first per CONTRIBUTING.md

## Checklist

- [ ] `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, and `npm test` pass locally
- [ ] Added or updated tests covering the change
- [ ] New or changed destructive/privileged tools are `confirm: true` gated and annotated `destructiveHint`; read-only tools are annotated `readOnlyHint`
- [ ] Updated the `Tools` list and tool count in `README.md` if tools changed
- [ ] Added an `## [Unreleased]` entry to `CHANGELOG.md` for any user-visible effect
- [ ] No personal details, real hostnames, real IPs (use `192.0.2.x`), account names, API keys, or unredacted absolute paths in code, tests, docs, or this PR (the content-guard check will fail otherwise)
- [ ] Conventional commit messages, no AI co-authorship trailers
